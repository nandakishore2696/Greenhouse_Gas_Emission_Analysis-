# Greenhouse_Gas_Emission_Analysis

Problem Statement : 

The Broader Public Sector (BPS) plays an important role in helping Ontario meet its conservation targets and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Under O. Reg. 507/18 (Broader Public Sector: Energy Reporting and Conservation and Demand Management Plans), made under the Electricity Act, 1998.

BPS organizations that are required to report include municipalities, municipal service boards, school boards, universities, colleges and hospitals. Several BPS organizations also voluntarily reported on facilities that are not required by regulation.

Project will analyze energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations, leveraging a comprehensive database of reported data.

We aim to identify trends, assess conservation effectiveness, and pinpoint areas for improvement, informing data-driven strategies to achieve climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.

Tools Employed :

Power BI
Power Query
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
Excel

Approach


After downloading the data, examined the data in the excel. The column names and number of column worksheet are different in different Excel Worksheets.
Using Power Query through power BI, processed the data. 
Handled different column names, data types,  removed columns that are not necessary .
Units of energy consumed, Natural gas consumed ,..etc are different for different rows. Converted all to same units, so that the results are correct
Using DAX, created calculated columns, to make analyze the data.
Created Visualizations to make meaning out of the data.

EDA Insights

From 2012, the greenhouse gas emissions are reducing YOY (year on year), even though the electricity consumption is increased YOY

There is also a increase in total indoor space YOY

The emissions are decreasing YOY, even though the weekly average hours of usage of electricity is increasing.

“School Boards” are consuming maximum percentage of 83.59 % of electricity 

The greenhouse emissions from school boards are very high with a staggering 97.78 %

The district heating is increasing YOY to 2017 and then started decreasing

District cooling is increasing and shown a decrease from 2019

The usage of fuel is showing a decreasing trend continuously

The usage of natural gas and propane is of no change with ups and downs.

Suggestions

Should instruct school boards to use renewable energy as they are the primary greenhouse emitters. 
Using renewable energy in school boards will change the ideology of the students , who are the future of the country.
Roof top solar panels kind of system should be employed to decrease the emissions
More focus should be on the top emitting cities i.e : north bay, timmins, Kapuskasing.
